# [Tranquil Tabs](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/TranquilTabs)
Web browser extension using JavaScript and Chrome's storage API to implement a url group based approach to helping users limit their online screen time or boost productivity and focus.

## How it Works
The user can create a group with a collection of regex matching urls, and specify information such as how many times they can open it, how long they can open it for, and optionally how long they have to wait to open it. This extension also supports scheduling of restrictions, for example, restricting access to social media sites during work hours.

## Design Reasoning
As someone who occasionally loses track of time scrolling funny videos or looking at friends posts, I wanted an extension that would help me take back active control of my screen usage and even cut me off if needed. As such, Tranquil Tabs was born.

On top of everything else, knowing that my extension will likely be used by those with disabilities or additional accomodations, I tried to keep my extension as accessabile as possible. Utilizing the POUR guidlines and even chatted with a good handful of people in these categories to ensure its usability and understandability.


# [Keep Scrolling](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/keep_scrolling)
Web browser extension utilizing JavaScript to relocate Youtube video comments, description, and recomended videos all to a scrollable side bar next to the video.

## Design Reasoning
This extension was design as a quick solution to a small problem. Often times when watching a Youtube video users like to read through the comments and see what others thought. However this moves the video out of sight, meaning you might miss something important. As such I felt simply moving the comments, as well as recomended videos, to a scrollable side bar would be beneficial and ensure nobody missed another second of their Youtube video again.

Furthermore, because this extension is relevant only to Youtube, I decided it was important to stay consistent with youtubes styling.

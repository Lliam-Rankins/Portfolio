# [Tranquil Tabs](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/TranquilTabs)
Web browser extension using JavaScript and Chrome's storage API to implement a url group based approach to helping users limit their online screen time or boost productivity and focus.

## How it Works
The user can create a group with a collection of regex matching urls, and specify information such as how many times they can open it, how long they can open it for, and optionally how long they have to wait to open it. This extension also supports scheduling of restrictions, for example, restricting access to social media sites during work hours.

## Design Reasoning
As someone who occasionally loses track of time scrolling funny videos or looking at friends posts, I wanted an extension that would help me take back active control of my screen usage and even cut me off if needed. As such, Tranquil Tabs was born.

On top of everything else, knowing that my extension will likely be used by those with disabilities or additional accomodations, I tried to keep my extension as accessabile as possible. Utilizing the POUR guidlines and even chatted with a good handful of people in these categories to ensure its usability and understandability.


# [Keep Scrolling](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/keep_scrolling)
Web browser extension utilizing JavaScript to relocate Youtube video comments, description, and recomended videos all to a scrollable side bar next to the video.

## Design Reasoning
This extension was design as a quick solution to a small problem. Often times when watching a Youtube video users like to read through the comments and see what others thought. However this moves the video out of sight, meaning you might miss something important. As such I felt simply moving the comments, as well as recomended videos, to a scrollable side bar would be beneficial and ensure nobody missed another second of their Youtube video again.

Furthermore, because this extension is relevant only to Youtube, I decided it was important to stay consistent with youtubes styling.


# [Coffee Maker](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/Coffee_Maker)
School Project to help improve our team work on a semester long project. This project utilized basic tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as more complex tool like REST API, MySQL. It also taught us how to use Github Actions, and general design frameworks such as AGILE.

## Design Reasoning
This project was focused on expanding our skill sets, and giving us practice in real word design philosophies. For example, we typically followed a pattern of planning a design/change of design, implementing the change, testing the change, and 'releasing' it. This led to a lot of refactoring, design sketches, team discussion, and overall improvment of the product.


# [DocsToRenPy](https://github.com/Lliam-Rankins/DocsToRenPy)
Personal addition to a senior design project that utilizing Regex matching to translate a markdown file into game code for a popular visual novel game engine.

## Design Reasoning
My team's senior design project was create a visual novel game about the united states legal system based off of our sponsors requirments. This series had multiple installments prior that were unpolished, buggy, and inaccessable. As such we decided to move away from the design platform they had used, Unity and a depreciated package Fungus, in lue of RenPy.

RenPy is a game engine specifically built for visual novels, and as such has many accessibility needs baked into the engine. Further more the design process is signifigantly simplier, allowing for a more complete game. However, due to the new nature of the platform and length of game script, using Git alone for colaborative work would have caused problems. As such we wrote the novel script in google docs, and I created a Python tool to translate the markdown file downloaded from google docs, and translate it into fully usable code files for the game engine. This signifigantly shortened development time and helped to reduce errors in the final product.
